/*
 * Quick and Dirty Scheduler for repetitive tasks
 * 
 * As the name says, the scheduler is very basic: it decides which task to run every SCHED_RATE_MS.
 * It keeps track of the last run time of each task and,
 * if current_millis - last_run_time is greater than or equal to the time interval between task runs,
 * then the selected task is run. If no task has to be run the it sleeps until the next iteration.
 * So basically each task function is executed in a periodic fashion.
 * 
 * Given how simple the scheduler is, there's an implicit support of task priority.
 * The tasks as run in a FIFO fashion with respect to calls of the sched_put_task() function. 
 * So, the first task in the list is the first to be run.
 * 
 * NOTE: this scheduler hijacks your loop() function. So avoid writing your own and just divide your
 *       workflow into tasks.
