/**
 * This header file acts both as a config file for the whole project and as a global description of the system.
 * 
 * A cece can be made up of four high-level modules, all optional. At least one of them should be present to obtain any meaningful functionality.
 * Such modules are:
 *  - mod_sensors    -> Responsible for querying the ambient sensor(s) at regular intervals and publishing the measurements using MQTT
 *  - mod_thermostat -> Regularly reflects on the local temperature to decide whether the heating system should be turned on or not.
 *                      Also uses MQTT to publish its output state
 *  - mod_relay      -> Enables or disables a relay depending on data received on its relative MQTT topic
 *  - mod_UI         -> Presents the users with a screen and buttons. It allows to present the sensor readings and control the thermostat using buttons.
 *                      I've yet to decide to make it configurable or set mod_thermostat as a hard requirement.
 * 
 * Once a module is enabled, its parameters are read from an .ini config file. Each section of the file corresponds to the module to be cofigured.
 * There is also a global section for the WiFi network parameters and any other config variable that affects all the modules.
 * 
 * Except for mod_relay that controls the relay directly, all modules use the following low(ish)-level drivers to interact with the hardware.
 * Their role is to arbitrate the access to the respective hardware resource.
 *  - AmbientSensor  -> to read ambient temperature, humidity, pressure whatever and present them nicely
 *  - MQTTdispatcher -> to register callbacks for the various topics each module subscribes to
 *  - qd_sched       -> simple task scheduler for all the repetitive stuff each component needs to run periodically
 *  
 *  Below those drivers are the specific Arduino libraries/drivers for each component.
 *  
 *  The high-level options of the drivers, such as what is connected where is configured here, more in-depth stuff is configured in the
 *  header file for each driver. Config variables here are updated when the hardware changes.
 *  Configuration variables related to actual behaviour, not dependent on the hardware go inside their relative source files.
